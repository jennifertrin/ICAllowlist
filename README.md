## How to Create an NFT claim website with an allowlist using ThirdWeb and the Internet Computer

By leveraging [**ThirdWeb**](https://thirdweb.com/) and the [**Internet Computer**](https://dfinity.org/), developers can build an NFT claim website that allows creators to assign NFTs to specific individuals through an allowlist.

**Thirdweb** is a comprehensive development framework that empowers you to seamlessly build, launch, and manage web3 applications and games across any Ethereum Virtual Machine chain. Used by thousands of developers in the ecosystem, Thirdweb has become the leading toolset for smart contract creation, data fetching, and more.

**The Internet Computer** (ICP) allows Web3 services to run 100% on-chain, providing the only platform where developers can build and users can enjoy fully decentralized applications. ICP ditches corporate cloud, insecure bridges, and expensive oracles. ICP can operate as a standalone layer-1 blockchain or as a highly efficient scalability infrastructure that can complement existing Ethereum projects.

In this tutorial, developers can enjoy the ease of development offered by Thirdweb while embracing the full decentralization capabilities of the Internet Computer. They add wallet authentication, deploy an Ethereum smart contract, mint an NFT and display it, and a claim button on a React application using Thirdweb. They can store a fully decentralized and tamper-proof allowlist on the Internet Computer and only allow users on the allowlist to claim the NFT.

### Get Started
